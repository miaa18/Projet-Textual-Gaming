"Next day..."
    "You're heading straight to the hospital of the neighboring city to inquire about the forensic doctor."
    r "How may i help you?"
    m "Ohh.. Hello, who is your forensic doctor here?"
    r "Mr Charles, our forensic doctor, who has extensive experience and is well-known in our city and even the neighboring towns due to the shortage of doctors, so he often travels."
    m "He's the father of the beautiful redhead, right!"
    r "Exactly, after losing his wife, his daughter is his only hope in life. She's everything in his eyes. Anyway, what do you need?"
    m "You mentioned that he travels a lot, so his work schedule is consistently busy?"
    r "Exactly, sometimes he's away from the hospital for several days to treat cases outside the city.He handles almost all the cases from several cities."
    r "Oh, there he is, going to his office. You can talk to him."
    "You turned around to see him, since he won't be available here for the next few days..."
    m "Thank you for your help i must go now i will come back another time."
    "You step out the hospital door with your heart pounding and begin to connect the dots"
    m "Charles, our forensic doctor, is popular in his city and the neighboring towns because of the shortage of doctors requiring him to travel. Consequently, Mina is left alone for days since he's all she has."
    m "Could this information help me? If Mina is not guilty, could her father be involved? If yes, what's the connection between our forensic doctor and our insane hacker? He wants to target his daughter because she's all he has left, and he absolutely wants him to believe she's dead and never return."
    m " I'm losing my mind; I don't think I'll be able to gather more information on them. It's time to tackle something else."
    m "Mr. Charles won't be available tomorrow, so I think I'll be able to work peacefully."
        "So, how would you go about completing this task ?"

m "Hey guys, do you know a little redhead around here?"
s "Yes, why? What do you want from her?"
 "You tell them that you need to gather some information about her... \n Everyone looks at you strangely.."
s "Mina, the forensic doctor's daughter? She gets out at 4:30 PM, you can ask her directly."
"You realize that you won't earn any information about her from them"
m "Daamn! that wasn't the better choice"
m "Hmm, so her name is Mina and her father is a forensic doctor."
"You go back to the city..\n
What are your plans for the next day?"

"You begin to chase after this bus. It stops at the edge of the city, and the girl waits in a square. You think she's waiting for another bus or someone who is supposed to pick her up."
"A very classy black car comes to pick her up, an elderly man wearing a white apron is driving, you think that he's her dad. She gets in, and takes a very bumpy road, it may be the road to the village."

"After ten minutes, the car takes a small turn and parks right next to it. You continue on, trying not to look like you're following them. From a distance, you observe a very beautiful house."

"But who is that one !!!"

'Suddenly, an elderly man stops right above me. "Hey you, do you need something?"'

[[Oh yes, yes. My mother sent me to the redheard's mother]]
[[Run away without giving any answer]]

 Me "Mina?"
 
 Student "Yeah, that little redhead. If you want more info about her, she lives in the small village nearby. She's a medical student because her father, who is a forensic doctor, really wanted her to be a doctor like him."

And what time does she finish her classes?

Around 4:30 pm

For a simple reason,you have to torture her so that she may suffer a little, but be careful not to kill her, she wasn't guilty.Then send to her family:"your daughter passed away", I would like to see her sad, all wounded face and the proof that her family believed her death."

"I know you didn't understand. How to convince them that she is dead while she isn't? That's the game we're going to play with the stolen money, as for the large sum of money, you will give it to her so that she leaves the village and goes as far away as possible, never to return"

"Well, you see that things are getting worse and worse. What a sick hacker and what a crazier request! you still can't see what drives him to do this. Either he has scores to settle or he's insane, picking people to see them suffer."

"Let's recap his demands: to torture a college girl and make her family believe she's dead with proof of it, the money is for her to leave. He really insists she must not come back so they believe her death. Oh, he also said she wasn't guilty..."
